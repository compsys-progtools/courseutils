##  Comparing languages you know

Tak a few minutes on your own to fill in the follwing table for two languages of your own. Replace the `<langugage>` with two languages that you are familiar with. Add two additional rows. You can do this by memory, or by looking up/discussing with class mates. If you look things up, be sure to use reputable sources and link to them below the table. 

```
| feature | <language1> | <language2> |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| use of whitespace     | lang1 use     | lang 2 use     |
| list/array types |   |  |
| variable typing |   |  | 
| memory usage |   |   | 
```
