# API

The primary way to use  `courseutils` is through the CLI as outlined through, but it can also be used as a Python library. 

This API is also useful for extending the CLI.  Many of these functions offer flexible processing of basic information that could be used to create additional CLI functionality beyond what is already implemented.
